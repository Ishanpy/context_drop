<task>
Analyze the existing documentation in the context_drop project and identify what's missing. Specifically:

1. Review all files in the documentation/ directory
2. Review the backend code structure (app/api/routes/, app/services/, app/ingestion/)
3. Review configuration files (.env.example, config.py, docker-compose.yml)
4. Identify gaps in documentation regarding:
   - Authentication/login mechanisms
   - Extension/integration points
   - Website/UI components
   - API usage and endpoints
   - Execution flow and data pipeline
   - User workflows
   - Security measures

Provide a detailed analysis of:
- What documentation currently exists
- What critical components are missing documentation
- What the system architecture reveals about undocumented features
- Specific gaps that need to be filled

This analysis will inform the creation of comprehensive documentation. Only analyze and report findings - do not create any documentation yet.

**Assistant:**

I'll analyze the context_drop project documentation and identify gaps. Let me start by examining the existing documentation and then reviewing the code structure.

<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>documentation/README.md</path>
  </file>
  <file>
    <path>documentation/WORKING_GUIDE.md</path>

  </file>
  <file>

**Assistant:**

Let me check the documentation directory structure first:

<list_files>
<path>documentation</path>
<recursive>true</recursive>
</list_files>

[list_files for 'documentation'] Result:
No files found.

**Assistant:**

The documentation directory appears to be empty. Let me check if there are documentation files in the root directory and then examine the backend code structure:

<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>backend/.env.example</path>
  </file>
  <file>
    <path>backend/app/config.py</path>
